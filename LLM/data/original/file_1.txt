Forty years ago, I used to be a great traveller, and was pretty well
acquainted with the means of transportation then in use; but about
that time, I retired to the country and settled upon a small farm,
where I have, until lately, pursued the even tenor of my way. During
the last summer, some business compelled me to set out for a distant
point, and I left my little home with extreme reluctance. As I was to
travel in a world about which I knew but little, except through the
newspapers, I thought it right to rig myself out in somewhat better
style than usual, so I put on my best _bib_ and _tucker_ and repaired
to town and sought a barber’s shop to get my hair cut and my beard
shaved, humming, as I went along, the old song, “I called to the barber, come shave me boy, do you hear,
   And I’ll give you sixpence for to spend in ale or beer;
   Shave me, shave me, barber come shave me,
   Make me look neat and spruce that Molly may have me.”

Sixpence quotha!—it cost me four and sixpence, at the least. When I
opened the door, I was so much astonished at the elegance of the
apartment, that I drew back, and would have retired, thinking I had
made some mistake, when two or three fellows flew out upon me, and
began brushing my coat with such impetuous violence, that I could not
escape from them; indeed, it was with much ado that I could prevent my
ears from being brushed off, by their whizzing brooms.
