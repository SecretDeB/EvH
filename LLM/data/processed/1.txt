forty years ago i used to be a great traveller and was pretty well acquainted with the means of transportation then in use but about that time i retired to the country and settled upon a small farm where i have until lately pursued the even tenor of my way.during the last summer some business compelled me to set out for a distant point and i left my little home with extreme reluctance.as i was to travel in a world about which i knew but little except through the newspapers i thought it right to rig myself out in somewhat better style than usual so i put on my best bib and tucker and repaired to town and sought a barber s shop to get my hair cut and my beard shaved humming as i went along the old song  i called to the barber come shave me boy do you hear   and i ll give you sixpence for to spend in ale or beer   shave me shave me barber come shave me   make me look neat and spruce that molly may have me. sixpence quotha it cost me four and sixpence at the least.when i opened the door i was so much astonished at the elegance of the apartment that i drew back and would have retired thinking i had made some mistake when two or three fellows flew out upon me and began brushing my coat with such impetuous violence that i could not escape from them indeed it was with much ado that i could prevent my ears from being brushed off by their whizzing brooms.
